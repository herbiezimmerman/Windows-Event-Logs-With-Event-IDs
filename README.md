# Windows-Event-Logs-With-Event-IDs
The following is a compiled list of some of the various Windows Event Logs and some of the event ids that may be found in the log. This initial list was pulled from [Hayabusa](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/) and [Events Ripper](https://github.com/keydet89/Events-Ripper).

Please note that some of these may not be available on a system since the source may have been disabled, or the auditing of the object has not be enabled. Yamato has an excellent guide on how to set up logging which can be found [here](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/EnableWindowsLogSettings).
